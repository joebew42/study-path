## Session 6: Practice with a new Programming Language

Principles and Practices are not dependent on any particular programming language, rather they act as support or enabler to learn and get comfortable with programming languages and tools we never used before.

Now that you have learned something about _the good principles and practices of software development_, try to grab a new programming language which you never used before and try to repeat some of the Code Katas you already have done previously:

- [FizzBuzzKata](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataFizzBuzz)
- [TheBowlingGameKata](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata)

If you are looking for more Code Katas to learn and practice with your new programming language, try to give a look at [Kata-Log](https://kata-log.rocks/).
